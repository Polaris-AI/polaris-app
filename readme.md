Polaris
=======
Polaris is an Augmented Reality app that gives realtime information about the product you're viewing, similar products and offers from multiple e-commerce websites.

Polaris is still under heavy development as it is a prototype built at a hack-a-thon. It's slow, but it works ;)

1. Open https://polaris.kunalvarma.in in a desktop or mobile web browser (Chrome, recommended).
2. Place a product in front of the camera. Make sure it's clearly visible without any obstacles.
3. Press the Start button.
3. Wait. And wait a bit more. If the camera was able to capture the image clearly, you'll be shown the details of the product.
